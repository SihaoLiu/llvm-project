# SihaoLiu/llvm-project Repository Overview

This is a special-purpose LLVM repository fork maintained for the following objectives:

1. **Base Synchronization**: Keep the main branch base aligned with the LLVM commit used by [CIRCT project](https://github.com/llvm/circt) to provide optimal CIRCT support.

2. **Feature Integration**: Integrate on top of this base:
   - Selected features from [ClangIR](https://github.com/llvm/clangir) not yet merged upstream
   - Custom-developed functionality

3. **Git History Structure**: 

```
*Latest commit*
↑
[Custom commits + ClangIR commits]
↑
*CIRCT-tracked commit (fork point)*
↑
[LLVM upstream history]
↑
*LLVM's first commit*
```

4. **Regular Updates**: Periodically update the fork point based on CIRCT's dependency changes.

Welcome to the LLVM project!

This repository contains the source code for LLVM, a toolkit for the
construction of highly optimized compilers, optimizers, and run-time
environments.

The LLVM project has multiple components. The core of the project is
itself called "LLVM". This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header
files needed to process intermediate representations and convert them into
object files. Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and
bitcode optimizer.

C-like languages use the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) frontend. This
component compiles C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ code into LLVM bitcode
-- and from there into object files, using LLVM.

Other components include:
the [libc++ C++ standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org),
the [LLD linker](https://lld.llvm.org), and more.
